4: Additional Testing and Spring Security's Influence
We've got two remaining scenarios to test: The case where a user tries to update a Cash Card which doesn't exist; and the case where a user tries to update a Cash Card they don't own.

Case 1: Attempt to update a Cash Card which does not exist.
Let's start with the first of those two cases. Start by adding a test.

Try to update a Cash Card that doesn't exist.

Add the following test to CashCardApplicationTests.

@Test
void shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatDoesNotExist() {
    CashCard unknownCard = new CashCard(null, 19.99, null);
    HttpEntity<CashCard> request = new HttpEntity<>(unknownCard);
    ResponseEntity<Void> response = restTemplate
            .withBasicAuth("sarah1", "abc123")
            .exchange("/cashcards/99999", HttpMethod.PUT, request, Void.class);
    assertThat(response.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
Here we'll attempt to update a Cash Card with ID 99999, which doesn't exist.

The test should expect a generic 404 NOT_FOUND error.

Run the tests.

Before running the test, guess what the result will be.

OK, have you made your guess? Now, run the test to verify your hypothesis.

...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatDoesNotExist() FAILED
 org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
 expected: 404 NOT_FOUND
  but was: 403 FORBIDDEN
Well that's...interesting. Why did we get a 403 FORBIDDEN?

Before we run them again, let's edit build.gradle to enable additional test output.

test {
 testLogging {
     ...
     // Change to `true` for more verbose test output
     showStandardStreams = true
 }
}
After rerunning the tests, search the output for the following:

CashCardApplicationTests > shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatDoesNotExist() STANDARD_OUT
...
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "example.cashcard.CashCard.id()" because "cashCard" is null
A NullPointerException! Why a NullPointerException?

Looking at CashCardController.putCashCard, we can see that if we don't find the cashCard, then method calls to cashCard will result in a NullPointerException. That makes sense.

But why is a NullPointerException thrown in our Controller resulting in a 403 FORBIDDEN instead of a 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, given the server "crashed?"

Remember: We learned in the Spring Security module that in order to avoid "leaking" information about our application, Spring Security has configured Spring Web to return a generic 403 FORBIDDEN in most error conditions. Thanks again, Spring Security!

Now that we understand what's happening, let's fix it.

Don't crash.

Though we're thankful to Spring Security, our application shouldn't crash - we shouldn't allow our code to throw a NullPointerException. Instead, we should handle the condition when cashCard == null, and return a generic 404 NOT_FOUND HTTP response.

Update CashCardController.putCashCard to return 404 NOT_FOUND if no existing CashCard is found.

@PutMapping("/{requestedId}")
private ResponseEntity<Void> putCashCard(@PathVariable Long requestedId, @RequestBody CashCard cashCardUpdate, Principal principal) {
    CashCard cashCard = cashCardRepository.findByIdAndOwner(requestedId, principal.getName());
    if (cashCard != null) {
        CashCard updatedCashCard = new CashCard(cashCard.id(), cashCardUpdate.amount(), principal.getName());
        cashCardRepository.save(updatedCashCard);
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    }
    return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
}
Run the tests.

Our tests pass now that we're returning a 404 when no CashCard is found.

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
Case 2: Attempt to update a Cash Card owned by someone else
Write a test for the remaining case.

Let's write a test that asserts that sarah1 isn't allowed to update one of kumar2's Cash Cards.

@Test
void shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatIsOwnedBySomeoneElse() {
    CashCard kumarsCard = new CashCard(null, 333.33, null);
    HttpEntity<CashCard> request = new HttpEntity<>(kumarsCard);
    ResponseEntity<Void> response = restTemplate
            .withBasicAuth("sarah1", "abc123")
            .exchange("/cashcards/102", HttpMethod.PUT, request, Void.class);
    assertThat(response.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
Make a hypothesis about what the test result will be, then verify the hypothesis by running the test.

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatIsOwnedBySomeoneElse() PASSED
Was your hypothesis correct?

The test passed because the modification to the Controller that we made in the previous step - namely, to check for a null result when retrieving the existing Cash Card - also causes this test to pass. But to be sure of this diagnosis, let's do an experiment.

Verify the reason for the test success.

Go ahead! Comment out the changes in the Controller, and run the tests again:

@PutMapping("/{requestedId}")
private ResponseEntity<Void> putCashCard(@PathVariable Long requestedId, @RequestBody CashCard cashCardUpdate, Principal principal) {
    CashCard cashCard = cashCardRepository.findByIdAndOwner(requestedId, principal.getName());
    // if (null != cashCard) {
        CashCard updatedCashCard = new CashCard(cashCard.id(), cashCardUpdate.amount(), principal.getName());
        cashCardRepository.save(updatedCashCard);
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    // }
    // return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
}
[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatIsOwnedBySomeoneElse() FAILED
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
expected: 404 NOT_FOUND
 but was: 403 FORBIDDEN
...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldNotUpdateACashCardThatDoesNotExist() FAILED
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
expected: 404 NOT_FOUND
 but was: 403 FORBIDDEN
We're back to the "crashing" state: Both tests result in 403 FORBIDDEN because of the underlying NullPointerException.

Undo your experimental changes.

Remember to un-comment the three lines in CashCardController.putCashCard

@PutMapping("/{requestedId}")
private ResponseEntity<Void> putCashCard(@PathVariable Long requestedId, @RequestBody CashCard cashCardUpdate, Principal principal) {
    CashCard cashCard = cashCardRepository.findByIdAndOwner(requestedId, principal.getName());
    if (null != cashCard) {
        CashCard updatedCashCard = new CashCard(cashCard.id(), cashCardUpdate.amount(), principal.getName());
        cashCardRepository.save(updatedCashCard);
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    }
    return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
}
Learning Moment: Controversy Exists
At this point you may ask yourself: Should I write two different tests which act exactly the same with respect to a single change in the application code? And if I should, why?

One reason why you might wish to keep the two tests is that at some future time, someone might change the implementation of the controller in some way that causes the two tests to actually act differently.

After all, we're testing two different scenarios:

A CashCard record with id=99999 does exist in the database.
A CashCard record with id=99999 does not exist in the database.
The truth is that if you bring this up as a conversation topic, you might get different answers from different people under different circumstances. While that might be interesting to talk about, as developers of the Family Cash Card API, we do need to move on.

Acknowledging that opinions may differ, we'll make the choice to leave both tests in place.
