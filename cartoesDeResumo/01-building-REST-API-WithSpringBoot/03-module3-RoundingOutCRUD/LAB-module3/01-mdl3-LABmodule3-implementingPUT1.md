2: Write the Test First
As we have in almost every lab, let's begin with a test.

What's the functionality that we want our application to have? How do we want our application to behave?

Let's define this now, then work our way towards satisfying our aspirations.

Write the Update test.

We'll use PUT to update CashCards.

Note that we'll expect a 204 NO_CONTENT response instead of a 200 OK. The 204 indicates that the action was successfully performed and no further action is needed by the caller.

Edit src/test/java/example/cashcard/CashCardApplicationTests.java, and add the following test, which updates Cash Card 99 and sets its amount to 19.99.

Don't forget to add the two new imports.

import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
...
@Test
@DirtiesContext
void shouldUpdateAnExistingCashCard() {
    CashCard cashCardUpdate = new CashCard(null, 19.99, null);
    HttpEntity<CashCard> request = new HttpEntity<>(cashCardUpdate);
    ResponseEntity<Void> response = restTemplate
            .withBasicAuth("sarah1", "abc123")
            .exchange("/cashcards/99", HttpMethod.PUT, request, Void.class);
    assertThat(response.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
}
Learning Moment: what's up with restTemplate.exchange()?
Did you notice that we're not using RestTemplate in the same way we have in our previous tests?

All other tests use RestTemplate.xyzForEntity() methods such as getForEntity() and postForEntity().

So, why aren't we following the same pattern of utilizing putForEntity()?

Answer: putForEntity() doesn't exist! Read more about it here in the GitHub issue about the topic.

Luckily RestTemplate supports multiple ways of interacting with REST APIs, such as RestTemplate.exchange().

Let's learn about RestTemplate.exchange() now.

Understand RestTemplate.exchange().

Let's understand more about what's happening.

The exchange() method is a more general version of the xyzForEntity() methods we've used in other tests: exchange() requires the verb and the request entity (the body of the request) to be supplied as parameters.

Using getForEntity() as an example, you can imagine that the following two lines of code accomplish the same goal:

.exchange("/cashcards/99", HttpMethod.GET, new HttpEntity(null), String.class);

The above line is functionally equivalent to the following line:

.getForEntity("/cashcards/99", String.class);

Now let's explain the test code.

First we create the HttpEntity that the exchange() method needs:

HttpEntity<CashCard> request = new HttpEntity<>(cashCardUpdate);
Then we call exchange(), which sends a PUT request for the target ID of 99 and updated Cash Card data:

.exchange("/cashcards/99", HttpMethod.PUT, request, Void.class);
Run the tests.

It's time to watch our tests fail for the right reasons.

For what reason will our new test fail?

Note that we'll always use ./gradlew test to run our tests.

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldUpdateAnExistingCashCard() FAILED
 org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
 expected: 204 NO_CONTENT
  but was: 403 FORBIDDEN
...
BUILD FAILED in 6s
Answer: We haven't implemented a PUT request method handler yet!

As you can see, the test failed with a 403 FORBIDDEN response code.

With no Controller endpoint, this PUT call is forbidden! Spring Security automatically handled this scenario for us. Nice!

Next, let's implement the Controller endpoint.
