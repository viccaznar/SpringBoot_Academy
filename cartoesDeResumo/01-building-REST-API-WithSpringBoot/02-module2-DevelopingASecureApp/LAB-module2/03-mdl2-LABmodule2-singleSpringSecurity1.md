1: Understand our Security Requirements
Who should be allowed to manage any given Cash Card?

In our simple domain, let's state that the user who created the Cash Card "owns" the Cash Card. Thus, they are the "card owner". Only the card owner can view or update a Cash Card.

The logic will be something like this:

IF the user is authenticated

... AND they are authorized as a "card owner"

... ... AND they own the requested Cash Card

THEN complete the users's request

BUT don't allow users to access Cash Cards they do not own.
