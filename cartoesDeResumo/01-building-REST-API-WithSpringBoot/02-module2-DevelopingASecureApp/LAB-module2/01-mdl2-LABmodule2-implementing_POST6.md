6: Understand the other changes to CashCardController
Our CashCardController now implements the expected input and results of an HTTP POST.

createCashCard(@RequestBody CashCard newCashCardRequest, ...)
Unlike the GET we added earlier, the POST expects a request "body". This contains the data submitted to the API. Spring Web will deserialize the data into a CashCard for us.

URI locationOfNewCashCard = ucb
   .path("cashcards/{id}")
   .buildAndExpand(savedCashCard.id())
   .toUri();
This is constructing a URI to the newly created CashCard. This is the URI that the caller can then use to GET the newly-created CashCard.

Note that savedCashCard.id is used as the identifier, which matches the GET endpoint's specification of cashcards/<CashCard.id>.

Where did UriComponentsBuilder come from?

We were able to add UriComponentsBuilder ucb as a method argument to this POST handler method and it was automatically passed in. How so? It was injected from our now-familiar friend, Spring's IoC Container. Thanks, Spring Web!

return ResponseEntity.created(locationOfNewCashCard).build();
Finally, we return 201 CREATED with the correct Location header.
