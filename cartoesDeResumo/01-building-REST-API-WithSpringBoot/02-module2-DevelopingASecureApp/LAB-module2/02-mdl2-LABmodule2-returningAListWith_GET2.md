2: Testing the New Data Contract
As we've done in previous workshops, we'll begin by writing a test of what we expect success to look like.

Since we are introducing a new data contract, we'll start by testing it!

Look at the new data fixtures.

Look at the src/test/resources/example/cashcard/list.json file. It contains the following JSON array:

[
  { "id": 99, "amount": 123.45 },
  { "id": 100, "amount": 1.0 },
  { "id": 101, "amount": 150.0 }
]
This is our new data contract containing a list of Cash Cards, matching the data in the new data.sql file; go ahead, look at the src/test/resources/data.sql file to verify that the JSON file's values match.

Now open the CashCardJsonTest.java file. Note class-level variable cashCards is configured to contain the following Java array:

cashCards = Arrays.array(
     new CashCard(99L, 123.45),
     new CashCard(100L, 100.00),
     new CashCard(101L, 150.00));
If you look closely you'll see that one of the CashCard objects in our test does not match the test data in data.sql. This is to set us up to write a failing test!

Add a serialization test for the Cash Card list.

Add a new test to CashCardJsonTest.java:

@Test
void cashCardListSerializationTest() throws IOException {
   assertThat(jsonList.write(cashCards)).isStrictlyEqualToJson("list.json");
}
The test code is self-explanatory: It serializes the cashCards variable into JSON, then asserts that list.json should contain the same data as the serialized cashCards variable.

Run the tests.

Can you predict whether the test will fail, and if it does, what the cause of the failure will be? Go ahead, make the call! What do you think will happen?

Verify your prediction by running the tests.

Note that we'll always run ./gradlew test to run the tests.

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
> Task :test FAILED
...
java.lang.AssertionError: JSON Comparison failure: [1].amount
Expected: 1.0
     got: 100.0
Your prediction was correct (hopefully)! The test failed. Happily, the error message points out the exact spot where the failure occurs: the amount field of the second CashCard in the array (index [1]) isn't what was expected.

Fix and rerun the tests.

Change cashCards[1].amount to expect the correct amount on the Cash Card.

To verify what amount the test should expect, look at the list.json file again. You'll see that the expected amount should be 1.00 instead of 100.0. So let's change the test code:

...
new CashCard(100L, 1.00),
...
After correcting the test code to expect 1.0 instead of 100.0 for the value of the amount field, re-run the tests. They will pass:

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s
Add a deserialization test.

Now let's test deserialization. Add the following test:

@Test
void cashCardListDeserializationTest() throws IOException {
   String expected="""
         [
            { "id": 99, "amount": 123.45 },
            { "id": 100, "amount": 100.00 },
            { "id": 101, "amount": 150.00 }
         ]
         """;
   assertThat(jsonList.parse(expected)).isEqualTo(cashCards);
}
Again, we've intentionally asserted an incorrect value to make it obvious what the test is testing.

Run the tests.

When you run the tests you'll see the incorrect value was caught.

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
> Task :test FAILED
...
 expected:
   [CashCard[id=99, amount=123.45],
       CashCard[id=100, amount=1.0],
       CashCard[id=101, amount=150.0]]
  but was:
   [CashCard[id=99, amount=123.45],
       CashCard[id=100, amount=100.0],
       CashCard[id=101, amount=150.0]]
This time, the test failed because we deserialized the expected JSON String, and compared it to the cashCards variable. Again, that pesky $100.00 Cash Card does not match the expectation.

Change the expectation:

String expected="""
    [
        { "id": 99, "amount": 123.45 },
        { "id": 100, "amount": 1.00 },
        { "id": 101, "amount": 150.00 }
    ]
    """;
Next, rerun the tests and watch the test pass:

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test
...
CashCardJsonTest > cashCardListDeserializationTest() PASSED
Now that we've tested the data contract, let's move on to the Controller endpoint.
