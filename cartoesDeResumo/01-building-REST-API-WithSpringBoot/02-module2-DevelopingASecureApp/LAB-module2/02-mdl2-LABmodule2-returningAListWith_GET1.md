1: Changes from the Previous Lab
We've made the following changes from the previous lab.

Added a couple more Cash Card data fixtures to src/test/resources/data.sql
Refactored CashCardJsonTest.java to incorporate the new data fixtures.
Renamed expected.json to single.json, and added another data contract JSON file: list.json.
Added some imports to the Test classes, so you don't have to!
Added the @DirtiesContext annotation to the CashCardApplicationTests class.
This list is just the summary. We'll expand on each point throughout the lab instructions.
