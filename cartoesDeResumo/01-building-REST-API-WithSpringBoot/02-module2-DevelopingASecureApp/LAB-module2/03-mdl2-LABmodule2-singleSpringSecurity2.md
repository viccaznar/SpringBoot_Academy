2: Review update from Previous Lab
In this lab we'll secure our Family Cash Card API and restrict access to any given Cash Card to the card's "owner".

To prepare for this, we introduced the concept of an owner in the application.

The owner is the unique identity of the person who created and can manage a given Cash Card.

Let's review the following changes we made on your behalf:

owner added as a field to the CashCard Java record.
owner added to all .sql files in src/main/resources/ and src/test/resources/.
owner added to all .json files in src/test/resources/example/cashcard.
All application code and tests are updated to support the new owner field. No functionality has changed as a result of these updates.

Let's take some time to familiarize yourself with these updates.
