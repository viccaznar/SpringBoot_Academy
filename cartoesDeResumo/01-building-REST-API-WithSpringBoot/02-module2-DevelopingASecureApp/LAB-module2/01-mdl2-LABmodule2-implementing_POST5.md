5: Understand CrudRepository.save
This line in CashCardController.createCashCard is deceptively simple:

CashCard savedCashCard = cashCardRepository.save(newCashCardRequest);
As learned in previous lessons and labs, Spring Data's CrudRepository provides methods that support creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a data store. cashCardRepository.save(newCashCardRequest) does just as it says: it saves a new CashCard for us, and returns the saved object with a unique id provided by the database. Amazing!
