10: Cash Card ownership: Creation Updates
We have one more remaining security hole: creating CashCards.

The authenticated, authorized Principal should be used as the owner when creating a new CashCard.

Question: What would happen if we automatically used the submitted owner value?

Answer: We risk allowing users to create CashCards for someone else!

Let's ensure that only the authenticated, authorized Principal owns the CashCards they are creating.

Update the POST test.

To prove that we don't need to submit an owner, let's use null as the owner for the CashCard.

void shouldCreateANewCashCard() {
  CashCard newCashCard = new CashCard(null, 250.00, null);
  ...
Run the tests.

What do you think will happen when we run the tests? They'll likely fail, but can you guess why?

To help us out, pass in the --info flag when running the tests so we can get a bit more insight into what's going on:

[~/exercises] $ ./gradlew test --info
...
CashCardApplicationTests > shouldCreateANewCashCard() FAILED
 org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
 expected: 201 CREATED
  but was: 403 FORBIDDEN
You'll see that the tests fail with a 403 FORBIDDEN error.

But why? Searching through the stacktrace we find the following:

DbActionExecutionException: Failed to execute InsertRoot{entity=CashCard[id=null, amount=250.0, owner=null], idValueSource=GENERATED}] with root cause

org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: NULL not allowed for column "OWNER"; SQL statement:
 INSERT INTO "CASH_CARD" ("AMOUNT", "OWNER") VALUES (?, ?) [23502-214]
Interesting! It seems that we tried to create a new CASH_CARD in the database, but NULL is not allowed as the OWNER, which is exactly what we passed in for the OWNER in our test.

Sure enough, more clues can be found in the main/resources/schema.sql, which sets up our database tables:

CREATE TABLE cash_card
(
  ...
  OWNER    VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
);
What does this all mean? It means that even though the tests (and users) see a 403 FORBIDDEN error, the application is actually crashing!

So, why aren't we seeing a 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, which is more appropriate for a crashing server?

Learning Moment: Spring Security and Error Handling
Our Controller is returning 403 FORBIDDEN instead of an 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR because Spring Security is automatically implementing a best practice regarding how errors are handled by Spring Web.

It's important to understand that any information returned from our application might be useful to a bad actor attempting to violate our application's security. For example: knowledge about actions that causes our application to crash -- a 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.

In order to avoid "leaking" information about our application, Spring Security has configured Spring Web to return a generic 403 FORBIDDEN in most error conditions. If almost everything results in a 403 FORBIDDEN response then an attacker doesn't really know what's going on.

Now that we understand what's happening, let's get the Controller to properly handle this situation.

Update the POST endpoint in the Controller.

Once again we'll use the provided Principal to ensure that the correct owner is saved with the new CashCard.

@PostMapping
private ResponseEntity<Void> createCashCard(@RequestBody CashCard newCashCardRequest, UriComponentsBuilder ucb, Principal principal) {
    CashCard cashCardWithOwner = new CashCard(null, newCashCardRequest.amount(), principal.getName());
    CashCard savedCashCard = cashCardRepository.save(cashCardWithOwner);
    ...
Run the tests.

Thankfully, everything passes again!

CashCardApplicationTests > shouldCreateANewCashCard() PASSED
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s
Now only the authenticated, authorized Principal is used to create a CashCard.

Security for the win!
